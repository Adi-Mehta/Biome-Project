After you have debugged the class and it passes its unit tests you'll have a better idea of what to implement in the other class.  Then you can start moving common behaviors to the Animal class while you are writing the other derived class.\n",

Your `live` method should check to make sure the fish is still alive.  The easiest way to do this is to include an instance variable named `_alive` that is set to True when the fish is initialized and set to False when it dies.\n",

As an example of how to use it, consider what would happen if we want to define `reproduce` in the Animal class so it is inherited by both Fish and Bear classes.
